# rescueCoalescent

Code to recreate "Genetic signatures of evolutionary rescue by a selective sweep" by Matthew Osmond and Graham Coop.

The manuscript is manuscript/main.pdf, which can be created with manuscript/main.tex. The figures within the manuscript are in figures/, and can be created within the Mathematica notebook, supplementary/notebook.nb. Creating these figures  requires the simulation data in supplementary/simulations/*/data/. And, finally, this simulation data (as well as the ignored tree sequences) can be created with the simulation code in supplementary/simulations/*/ (requires SLiM 3, msprime, pyslim, tskit, and Python 3).

Happy to answer any questions by email.

Thanks,
Matt
